<center>Hello this is my crane. Also Here is my skeleton of my building.&nbsp;
It is about a yard tall.&nbsp; Both the building and the crane is not completed.&nbsp;
Because the crane is not completed.&nbsp; I have the following picture
of what is missing.
<br>It is power by remote control and MindStorm.&nbsp; The Best mindstorm.&nbsp;
Three output (motors).
<br>One is to make 360 circle.&nbsp; (no limits of 360 circle)
<br>Two is to move the crane with chains.
<br>Moving the string away and to the crane.
<br>Three is add or release the string.&nbsp; I hope that clears it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</center>

is missing two 1x4 white technic bricks.&nbsp; That is all I need.&nbsp;
I have two 1x16 dk. gray technic bricks to go on the side.&nbsp; But I
need two 1x4 white technic bricks.&nbsp;
<p>Again.&nbsp; I <b>need</b> 2 of 1x4 white technic bricks.</center>

<center>This is my Lego Land, So far.&nbsp; It is not much, but it will
expand.&nbsp; The wires that you see across the roads is wires from TV
to minature camera.&nbsp; So I can record on tape and hopefully I can change
