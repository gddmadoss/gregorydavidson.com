<h1>Hello Gregory</h1>
<h2>I have a birthday present for you.</h2>
<font size="5">
<p>
I made you a game for your birthday present.<br>
You must catch 43 candles to win since it<br>
is your 43rd birthday. The goal of the game<br>
is to catch all of your candles in your birthday<br>
cake. Gotta catch 'em all!!
</p>
<p>
In order to restart<br>
the game, you must refresh the page. Also,<br>
there is a chance that you lose. You lose<br>
when the candles run out. And finally, MAKE<br>
SURE that you have loud, loud speakers so you<br>
can hear my custom sound effects!! Most of all,<br>
have FUN and HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!
</p>

Click the button to start the game!
